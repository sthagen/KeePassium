KeePassium icons are based on "Bold outline icons" by Roundicons,
used under the terms of their proprietary "extended" license.

License terms at the time of purchase:

For the purpose of that license, the open source version of KeePassium is a 
"template" that anyone can use to build a version of KeePassium. The icons 
distributed in raster (non-vector) format, strictly as part of KeePassium, 
are thus covered by the project's license.

If you want to use Bold Outline Icons separately from KeePassium,
you might need to acquire your own license from Roundicons:
